# ADR-0162: Higher-fidelity FEM microstrip port — power-wave normalization + multi-mode (the filter-S21 floor)

**Status:** Accepted (track kickoff; maintainer-funded 2026-06-05)
**Date:** 2026-06-05
**Related:** ADR-0147 (#1 goal: a mask-clearing full-wave filter S21), ADR-0153/0154 (FEM driven-sweep +
the N1/N2/N3 numerical-eigenmode port), ADR-0159 (B2: dimensioning is a minor lever → port-bound),
[[fem-driven-sweep-s21-viable]], [[project-filter-design-final-goal]].

---

## Context

The FEM driven-sweep is validated for ε_eff (B4, 0.61 % of Hammerstad-Jensen) and coupling-k (K1/K2),
and the numerical-eigenmode microstrip port (ADR-0154) is matched + high-transmission on a **straight
thru** (`|S21|≈0.778`, `|S11|≈0.087`). But the 3-pole edge-coupled **filter** S21 floors at ≈ −27 dB
(N3) / −21.5 dB (B2), missing the Chebyshev mask. ADR-0159 (B2) showed gap-dimensioning lifts it only
+5.8 dB → the dominant floor is **port fidelity**, not dimensioning. The maintainer funded a
higher-fidelity-port track (2026-06-05).

**Research + diagnosis (two read-only agents, research-first — see the source list):** the floor has a
specific, testable root cause.

1. **The S21 extraction uses an E-field L² normalization, not power-wave normalization.**
   `OpenBoundarySolver::extract_s_qp` / `extract_s11` (`crates/yee-fem/src/open_boundary.rs` ~1853–2124)
   compute `S_qp = ⟨E_FEM,t, e_mode_q⟩_port / M_qq − a_inc`, with `M_qq = Σ_face w_g (e_mode·e_mode)` —
   the real E-field self-overlap `∫|e_mode|²`, NOT the modal power `Re ∫(e_mode × h_mode*)·ẑ`. The
   `PortDefinition` carries only `modal_e_t` + a scalar `beta_mode` — **no modal H-field, no per-point
   wave impedance**.

2. **Smoking gun:** even on the matched, lossless straight thru, `|S11|²+|S21|² ≈ 0.087²+0.778² ≈ 0.61`
   — ~39 % of incident power is unaccounted-for. A correct power-conserving extraction gives `≈ 1` for a
   lossless 2-port. So the extraction is **not power-unitary**.

3. **Why a thru is "OK" but a filter floors.** Microstrip is **inhomogeneous** (air + dielectric), so the
   modal wave impedance varies across the cross-section; the E-only norm mis-weights the power. On a
   uniform mode-matched thru the S-parameter *ratio* survives (≈0.78), but on the filter (a) each coupling
   gap launches higher-order / evanescent modes carrying real power that the **single-mode** projection
   silently discards, and (b) the inhomogeneous-Z mis-weighting compounds. Result: the extracted
   fundamental-mode |S21| collapses.

4. **Caveat (must be separated in the de-risk):** the thru's 39 % deficit may be *partly* the known ~30 %
   numerical Q-floor (ADR-0156/K3: `|S11|@res` coupling-invariant ≈0.84). The de-risk B1 must distinguish
   an **extraction-normalization artifact** (fixable by power-normalization) from **real numerical loss**
   (a different, harder problem).

## Decision

Pursue the port-fidelity track in **de-risk-first bricks**, each machine-checkable. The diagnosis suggests
the first fix may be far cheaper than "multi-week" (a power-normalization correction), so B1 measures
before B2+ commits.

| # | Brick | Gate / decision |
|---|-------|-----------------|
| **B1** | **De-risk (decisive, cheap — on the THRU, not the heavy filter).** (a) Print `\|S11\|²+\|S21\|²` for the thru + (the existing) filter sweep. (b) Implement a **power-normalized re-extraction** of the SAME solved thru field: obtain the modal H (from the cross-section eigensolver if it exposes `h_t`, else the quasi-TEM relation `h_t = ẑ×e_t · Y(x,y)` with the per-point modal admittance, or `h = ∇×E/(−jωμ)`), normalize by `Re ∫(e×h*)·ẑ`. | If the thru's `\|S11\|²+\|S21\|²` rises `0.61 → ~1` under power-normalization ⇒ **the L² normalization is the bug** ⇒ proceed to B2. If it stays ≈0.61 ⇒ the deficit is **real numerical loss** (the K3 Q-floor) ⇒ NO-GO for the normalization fix; re-scope to the Q-floor (honest documented outcome). Decisive + cheap (line solve, not the 40-min filter). |
| B2 | **Power-wave normalization** (if B1 implicates the norm). Add `modal_h_t` (or a per-point wave impedance) to `PortDefinition`; replace the L² `M_qq` in `extract_s_qp`/`extract_s11` with `Re ∫(e×h*)·ẑ`; keep the excitation reciprocal. | The thru gate: `\|S11\|²+\|S21\|²→~1`, `\|S21\|`/ε_eff stay within their N2/B4 tolerances (no regression). Then re-run the **filter** (heavy, boxed): does the in-band peak lift toward the mask? Record honestly. |
| B3 | **Multi-mode port** (if B2 leaves a floor — power leaking into unmodeled modes at the coupling gaps). Add higher-order cross-section modes as `a_inc=0` absorbing projectors (`PortDefinition` already supports `Vec<PortMode>`) + sum per-mode power in the extraction. | The filter in-band peak lifts further / clears the mask; per-mode power accounting closes `\|S11\|²+\|S21\|²→1` on the filter. |
| B4 | **Hardening / fallback** (only if needed): thru-line de-embed (scikit-rf `Network.inv`/`**` style — a systematic launch-error removal, NOT a floor fix) and/or a PML-backed absorbing port for residual higher-order leakage. | Filter S21 robust to the launch / reference-plane; documented. |

**Start B1** — the cheapest experiment that determines the entire track's direction (and whether it is
even a normalization problem vs the numerical Q-floor). Misfire-split: an agent writes the code, the
orchestrator runs the (cheap) thru de-risk boxed.

## De-risk outcome (B1 + B1.5 — DECISIVE; branch `feature/fem-port-power-norm`, B1 `c2f4f97`, B1.5 `cb84ab0`)

Self-verified boxed on the matched straight thru (lossless FR-4, PEC metal — physically lossless):

| measurement | result |
|---|---|
| `\|S11\|²+\|S21\|²`, current **E-only L²** extraction | **0.6145** (reproduces the smoking gun) |
| `\|S11\|²+\|S21\|²`, **quasi-TEM √ε_r power-norm** (B1) | 0.6725 (lifts only +0.06 — the approximate modal-H *shape* barely helps) |
| **P_out/P_in, true-field Poynting flux** `½Re∫(E×H*)·n̂`, H=∇×E/(−jωμ) (B1.5) | **0.9982** |
| `\|S21\|²/(1−\|S11\|²)` (same field, via the S-formula) | 0.6109 |

**Conclusion — the B1-only NO-GO is OVERTURNED:** the solved FEM field **conserves energy** (transmits
0.998 of the incident power port-to-port — lossless to 0.2 %, the per-port fluxes near-equal-and-opposite
`[−1.714e-10, +1.711e-10] W`, the lossless-2-port signature). The ~39 % deficit is therefore a **pure
EXTRACTION-normalization artifact**, NOT real solver/ABC/numerical loss. The K3 Q-floor is **not** what
floors a *non-resonant* thru. **⇒ the filter-S21 floor is an EXTRACTION problem (the cheap, tractable
side of the fork), not a solver wall — the track is SALVAGEABLE.**

B1.5's true H came from a new `pub(crate) element::tet_whitney_e_and_curl` (reuses the assembly's exact
`∇×N_α = 2∇λ_i×∇λ_j` Whitney-1 curl — no re-derivation) + `OpenBoundarySolver::poynting_flux_audit`.

**This reframes B2** (supersedes the table's B2): NOT "productionize the quasi-TEM √ε_r power-norm" (B1
showed it barely helps — its modal-H *shape* is approximate), but a **flux-calibrated extraction** —
unit-incident-power-normalize the modal projection against the **true** modal power flux (the
Palace/COMSOL recipe Yee skipped: normalize the modal field so `½Re∫(e_m×h_m*)·ẑ = 1` first, with an
accurate modal H — e.g. from a reference thru-solve's `∇×E`, which B1.5's evaluator now provides — then
`a_m = ∫(E_FEM×h_m*)·ẑ`). Target: the thru `|S21| → ~1` (matching the 0.998 flux) + `|S11|²+|S21|² → 1`,
with ε_eff/β unchanged (N2/B4 stay green). Then B3' applies the corrected extraction to the **filter**
(heavy boxed) + a flux audit on the filter passband → does the in-band |S21| lift toward the mask? (If
the filter field also transmits in-band, the −27 dB was largely an extraction artifact and the mask may
be reachable; if the filter field genuinely reflects in-band, that residual is real.)

## Consequences

- If B1+B2 confirm + fix the normalization, a mask-clearing (or much-closer) full-wave filter S21 may be
  reachable **without** the full multi-week effort — a large win for the ADR-0147 #1 goal.
- If B1 shows the deficit is the numerical Q-floor, that is an honest NO-GO for the port-normalization
  fix and re-scopes the track (the Q-floor is the real wall) — documented, not faked.
- Scope: `crates/yee-fem/src/open_boundary.rs` (the extraction + `PortDefinition`),
  `crates/yee-fem/src/microstrip_port_numerical.rs` (the port builder, modal H), possibly
  `crates/yee-mom/src/ports.rs` (expose the cross-section modal H), + the line/filter gates.
- **Not in scope / do NOT reopen:** the dimensioning lever (ADR-0159, minor), FDTD-resonant (ADR-0108),
  mom-002/003 (ADR-0064), fem-eig-006.

- **De-embedding:** scikit-rf `skrf.calibration` (TRL, IEEEP370 2x-thru, `SplitPi/Tee`) — hardening, not
  the primary fix (won't lift an extraction/multi-mode floor; leaves mismatch ripple).

  multi-mode; the repo's own ADR-0049/0070 absorbing-complement (note: first-order barely moved |S11| on
  WR-90 — treat PML-backed as a refinement, not the lead).
