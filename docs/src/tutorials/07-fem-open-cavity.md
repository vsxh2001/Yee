# Open-boundary FEM driven sweep from Python

This tutorial walks through Yee's **Phase 4.fem.eig.2** open-boundary
FEM driver from Python. It is the open-region follow-on to
[Tutorial 6 — Dispersive FEM cavity eigenmode](06-fem-cavity-dispersive.md):
where Phases 4.fem.eig.0/1 returned cavity eigenpairs on a fully
PEC-bounded box, the v2 solver consumes a mesh whose exterior faces
are partitioned into PEC, **1st-order Engquist–Majda absorbing
boundary (ABC)**, and **modal wave-port** classes, assembles a
complex-symmetric driven system per swept frequency, and returns the
frequency-swept **S-parameter matrix** via a single complex sparse LU
back-substitution per frequency point.

## Goal

Solve the driven open-region Helmholtz problem

```text
∇ × (1/μ_r) ∇ × E − k₀² ε_r E = 0    in Ω
n̂ × E = 0                            on Γ_PEC
n̂ × ∇×E = −j k₀ n̂ × (n̂ × E)         on Γ_ABC
E_t = (a_inc + b) · e_mode(x,y)      on Γ_port
```

on a small WR-90 stub, recover `|S_{11}(f)|` across an 8–12 GHz sweep,
and confirm the passivity + monotonicity sanity gates baked into the
`fem-eig-003` validation driver. The Phase 4.fem.eig.2 spec
([`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-19-phase-4-fem-eig-2-open-boundary-design.md`](../../superpowers/specs/2026-05-19-phase-4-fem-eig-2-open-boundary-design.md))
scopes the v2 deliverable to:

- **1st-order Engquist–Majda ABC** on tagged exterior faces — adds
  `+ j k₀ · area · (n̂ × N_i) · (n̂ × N_j)` per face into the global
  complex stiffness matrix `K(ω)`, promoting the system to
  complex-symmetric even with real `ε_r`.
- **Single dominant-mode wave-port faces** sourced from
  `NumericalCrossSection::e_tangential_at` (Phase 1.3.1.1) with an
  incident modal amplitude on the right-hand side and `S_{11}(f)`
  extracted via modal projection of the FEM solution.
- **Frequency sweep** via per-frequency complex sparse LU
  back-substitution on the Phase 4.fem.eig.1 `faer` surface.
- **Validation gate `fem-eig-003` (WR-90 stub + ABC)**: passivity
  `|S_{11}| ≤ 1 + ε_num` and adjacent-bin smoothness, both enforced
  in default CI; the strict `[−45, −35] dB` ABC absorption window is
  `#[ignore]`'d at the v0 walking-skeleton mesh resolution pending a
  modal-RHS scaling fix (queued as Phase 4.fem.eig.2.0.1 /
  4.fem.eig.2.5).

The v2 scope, deferrals, and the absorption-floor finding are
recorded in
[ADR-0040](../decisions/0040-phase-4-fem-eig-2-open-boundary-scope.md);
the parallel pattern of open-question surfacing (rather than ad-hoc
gate weakening) is also tracked in
[ADR-0041](../decisions/0041-fdtd-007-reference-correction.md).

## Prerequisites

- Rust 1.92+ (`rust-toolchain.toml` pins the toolchain; the Python
  wheel is built from source).
- Python 3.10 through 3.14 — the wheel is `abi3-py310`, so any
  interpreter in that range works without rebuilding.
- `uv pip install maturin numpy pytest` — or the equivalent
  `pip install` invocation.

Install matches [Tutorial 6](06-fem-cavity-dispersive.md) exactly:

```bash
uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install maturin numpy pytest
cargo build --release -p yee-fem -p yee-py
cd crates/yee-py
maturin develop --release
python -c "import yee.fem; help(yee.fem.solve_open_cavity)"
```

`maturin develop --release` is non-negotiable on the open-boundary
path: each swept frequency point re-assembles a complex sparse
pencil and factors a `Complex64` LU. Debug builds are an order of
magnitude slower and unsuitable for sweep work.

## WR-90 stub — first call

The minimal end-to-end snippet — air-filled WR-90 stub, ABC at
`z = 0`, TE_{10} wave-port at `z = d`, sweep across 8–12 GHz:

```python
import math
import yee.fem

a = 0.02286    # WR-90 broad wall (m)
b = 0.01016    # WR-90 narrow wall (m)
d = 0.030      # axial stub length (m)

# Constant tangential TE_{10} amplitude at the broad-wall midpoint.
# e_mode(x,y) = ŷ · sqrt(2 / (a·b)) · sin(π x / a); sampled at x = a/2
# the sin term is 1, so modal_e_t reduces to (0, sqrt(2/(a·b)), 0).
te10_norm = math.sqrt(2.0 / (a * b))

# 50-point uniform sweep, 8-12 GHz.
omegas = [(8.0 + 4.0 * i / 49.0) * 1e9 for i in range(50)]

s = yee.fem.solve_open_cavity(
    a, b, d, 8, 4, 16,
    materials=[{"tag": 0, "eps_inf": 1.0, "mu_r": 1.0, "poles": []}],
    port_faces=[
        {"axis": "z", "side": "high", "port_id": 0,
         "modal_e_t": (0.0, te10_norm, 0.0)},
    ],
    abc_faces=[{"axis": "z", "side": "low"}],
    omegas_hz=omegas,
)

for i, om in enumerate(omegas):
    s11_db = 20 * math.log10(abs(s[i, 0, 0]))
    print(f"f = {om/1e9:.2f} GHz   |S11| = {s11_db:+.3f} dB")
```

`s` is a complex `numpy.ndarray` of shape `(n_omegas, n_ports,
n_ports)` — here `(50, 1, 1)` — indexed as `s[i, k, j] = S_{kj}(ω_i)`.

Expected output: `|S_{11}(f)| ≈ 0 dB` (numerical-1.0) across the
entire band. That is **not** the published 1st-order Engquist–Majda
floor (`~ −40 dB`) — it is the v0 walking-skeleton modal-RHS scaling
saturation surfaced by Track BBBBBBBBB during the `fem-eig-003`
landing (see "Known limitations" below). The shape of the sweep is
flat-at-unity rather than noisy, which is itself a useful diagnostic:
the structure is being treated as effectively closed, not as a leaky
absorber.

## Face classification

The Phase 4.fem.eig.2 binding partitions every exterior face into one
of three tags. Unannotated exterior faces default to **PEC** — every
Phase 4.fem.eig.0/1 caller therefore round-trips unchanged.

- **`port_faces`** — one dict per physical wave-port face. Required
  keys:
  - `axis`: `"x" | "y" | "z"` — the axis-aligned face normal direction.
  - `side`: `"low" | "high"` — which of the two opposing faces on
    that axis.
  - `port_id`: `int` — the column index in the returned S-parameter
    matrix.
  - `modal_e_t`: `(ex, ey, ez)` — constant tangential modal `E`-field
    sampled at the face centroid. For TE_{10} on a rectangular
    waveguide the sampled value at `x = a/2` is the orthonormalised
    amplitude `sqrt(2 / (a·b))` along the broad-wall-perpendicular
    axis.
- **`abc_faces`** — one dict per Engquist–Majda absorbing face. Keys
  `axis` and `side` only; the ABC face block is parameter-free at v0
  (the `+ j k₀` weight is implied).
- **Default-PEC** — every exterior face not listed under `port_faces`
  or `abc_faces` is treated as a tangential-`E`-zero Dirichlet wall.
  This is the same boundary condition the Phase 4.fem.eig.0
  closed-cavity solver enforces on every exterior face.

> **Multi-port S-matrix extraction is deferred.** v0 supports any
> number of port faces in the `port_faces` list but the returned
> S-parameter columns beyond `port_id = 0` are populated from a
> *single-incident* solve per frequency, not the per-port excitation
> matrix the multi-port S-formalism requires. Full multi-port driving
> lands in **Phase 4.fem.eig.2.0.2**; until then, treat `n_ports > 1`
> sweeps as `S_{*0}(f)` columns only.

## Validation

The corresponding validation gate, **`fem-eig-003`**, lives at
`crates/yee-validation/tests/fem_eig_003_wr90_stub_abc.rs` and drives
the public `yee_validation::run_fem_eig_003_wr90_stub_abc` helper.
The driver assembles the spec-scale mesh `(nx, ny, nz) = (16, 8, 24)`
(18 432 tets) with the analytic TE_{10} modal source on the `z = d`
face and the 1st-order ABC on `z = 0`, then sweeps 50 uniform points
across 8–12 GHz.

The default-CI gates are:

1. **Passivity** — `|S_{11}(f)| ≤ 1 + ε_num` with `ε_num = 0.05` at
   every swept point (the strict `< 1` continuum bound is `#[ignore]`'d
   under the plan E5 escape hatch — see below).
2. **Smoothness** — adjacent-bin `|Δ(20·log₁₀|S_{11}|)| ≤ 10 dB`. No
   spurious near-cavity resonance appears in the propagating band.
3. **Finiteness** — every entry is finite (no NaN / Inf).

The strict ABC-absorption gate `|S_{11}(f)|_dB ∈ [−45, −35] dB` is
`#[ignore]`'d pending the Track CCCCCCCCC modal-RHS scaling fix.
Run it explicitly via `cargo test -- --ignored` once that lands.

The row in `crates/yee-fem/validation/README.md` carries the
spec-scale mesh, the per-gate tolerance breakdown, and the
finding-history pointers.

## Known limitations

- **`|S_{11}(f)| = 1.0` saturation at v0 mesh resolution.** Track
  BBBBBBBBB's E5 landing measured `|S_{11}(f)| ≈ 1.000_000_000`
  numerically across the entire 8–12 GHz sweep on the spec-scale
  `(16, 8, 24)` mesh — the published 1st-order Engquist–Majda
  reflection floor `~ −40 dB` does **not** resolve at the
  walking-skeleton mesh + face-centroid modal-RHS combination shipped
  in v0. The ABC face block measurably differs from PEC (`Im(S_{11})`
  differs at `~1e-10` vs `~1e-8` on the coarse mesh), but the
  modal-source RHS is too weak to discriminate from a fully-PEC
  structure on a real WR-90 sweep. The strict absorption-floor gate
  is `#[ignore]`'d under the plan E5 escape hatch ("if walking-skeleton
  physics doesn't resolve `-40 dB` at 25 k tets, document and
  continue"). Full discussion in `crates/yee-fem/validation/README.md`
  E5 findings.
- **Track CCCCCCCCC modal-RHS scaling fix is in flight.** The agreed
  follow-up is to re-derive the per-Gauss-point modal projection
  (cubic interpolation per ADR-0040 §C-3 amendment) and re-scale the
  RHS to match the spec §4.3 closed form. Once it lands, the
  `#[ignore]`'d strict gate can be lifted with a single attribute
  removal — no API surface change is required, and every snippet in
  this tutorial keeps producing the same `s` array shape.
- **Single dominant mode per port at v0.** Higher-order modes are
  *captured* in the modal reflection spectrum (they show up as
  band-edge artefacts past the TE_{10} cutoff at ~6.56 GHz on WR-90)
  but are not *driven*. Multi-mode incident excitation lands in
  4.fem.eig.2.0.2.
- **Combining the v2 open-boundary path with v1's dispersive Newton
  tracker** is a Phase 4.fem.eig.2.1 superposition exercise. The
  driven sweep at v0 supports lossless or constant-real-loss interior
  media only; do not mix `poles=[…]` materials with `port_faces` in
  the same call (the call accepts the shape, but the dispersive
  ε(ω) is not iterated and the result is not physically meaningful).

## What's next

Phase 4.fem.eig.2 is a strict extension of the closed-cavity walking
skeleton — every Phase 4.fem.eig.0 / 4.fem.eig.1 caller round-trips
unchanged, and the `OpenBoundarySolver` is rejected at construction
with an empty `abc_faces` and empty `ports` (no excitation → no
well-posed driven problem). The roadmap lays out the immediate
follow-ons:

- **Phase 4.fem.eig.2.0.1** — cubic / per-Gauss-point modal-profile
  interpolation on the FEM port face, retiring the v0 face-centroid
  sample and lifting the strict `fem-eig-003` absorption gate.
- **Phase 4.fem.eig.2.0.2** — multi-port incident-excitation matrix
  formalism; full `n_ports × n_ports` S-matrix per swept frequency.
- **Phase 4.fem.eig.2.5** — 2nd-order Engquist–Majda / Higdon /
  CFS-PML termination if the 1st-order floor cannot meet a future
  published-benchmark tolerance.
- **Phase 4.fem.eig.3** — driven-Maxwell solver: dielectric-resonator
  antennas, coax-fed dipoles in ABC-terminated FEM boxes
  (`fem-eig-004` cross-checks against the `mom-001` NEC-4 reference),
  iris-coupled bandpass filters.
