//! Closed-form microstrip dimensional synthesis (Filter Phases F1.2.0 / F1.2.2 /
//! F1.2.3 / F1.2.5).
//!
//! Turns an abstract synthesized [`crate::CouplingMatrix`] (or low-pass
//! prototype) into **physical microstrip dimensions** for three coupled-resonator
//! band-pass topologies — the edge-coupled half-wave filter
//! ([`dimension_edge_coupled`], F1.2.0), the U-folded **hairpin** filter
//! ([`dimension_hairpin`], F1.2.2), and the capacitively-loaded **combline**
//! filter ([`dimension_combline`], F1.2.5) — plus the **stepped-impedance**
//! low-pass ([`dimension_stepped_impedance`], F1.2.3), by inverting the
//! already-validated `yee-layout` closed-form models. Pure `f64`, WASM-safe, NO
//! FDTD, NO surrogate — this is the *initial* dimensioning that seeds the later
//! EM-in-the-loop refinement (F1.2.1).
//!
//! The three coupled-resonator band-pass topologies share the **same
//! inter-resonator coupling mechanism**: adjacent resonators couple through the
//! edge gap between their lines — the edge-coupled gap→`k` inversion. They
//! therefore reuse the identical [`solve_gap`] bisection and the
//! `target_k = FBW · m_{i,i+1}` derivation below; only the resonator geometry
//! differs — a straight λ/2 strip (edge-coupled), a folded half-wave = two ≈λ/4
//! arms (hairpin, see [`dimension_hairpin`]), or a short-circuited θ0 < π/2 line
//! capacitively loaded to resonance (combline, see [`dimension_combline`]).
//!
//! # Method (Hong & Lancaster ch. 8 / Pozar §8.7)
//!
//! For an `N`-pole edge-coupled half-wave filter:
//!
//! - **Line width** — the spec-`Z0` Hammerstad-Jensen synthesis width
//!   ([`yee_layout::microstrip_width`]).
//! - **Resonator length** — a half guided wavelength at `f0`,
//!   `ℓ = λ_g/2 = c / (2·f0·√ε_eff)`, with `ε_eff` from
//!   [`yee_layout::eps_eff`] at the synthesized width (`c = 299_792_458` m/s).
//! - **Inter-resonator gaps** — for each adjacent resonator pair `(i, i+1)` the
//!   coupling coefficient `k_{i,i+1} = FBW · m_{i,i+1}` is realized by a coupled
//!   section whose voltage coupling
//!   `(Z0e − Z0o)/(Z0e + Z0o)` ([`yee_layout::coupling_coefficient`]) equals
//!   `k_{i,i+1}`. Because that coupling is **strictly decreasing in the gap `s`**
//!   (`yee-layout`'s `coupled_002` gate), the inverse "gap that realizes a target
//!   `k`" is found exactly by **bisection** — no optimizer, no FDTD.
//!
//! ## Cross-check: `target_k = FBW · m_{i,i+1}` equals `yee-synth`'s `k`
//!
//! `yee-synth::coupling_design` builds the normalized matrix with
//! `m[i][i+1] = 1/√(g_i g_{i+1})` and the inter-resonator coupling
//! `k_{i,i+1} = FBW / √(g_i g_{i+1})`. Hence
//! `FBW · m[i][i+1] = FBW / √(g_i g_{i+1}) = k_{i,i+1}` exactly — so multiplying
//! the off-diagonal of [`crate::CouplingMatrix::m`] by `spec.fbw` reproduces the
//! synthesized `k` vector, which is the target each gap is solved for.

/// bisection and the `target_k = FBW · m_{i,i+1}` derivation (see the

///
/// The interdigital-**distinct** point is the resonator: it is the `θ = π/2`
/// limit of the combline line, where the short-circuited stub's input
/// susceptance `B(f0) = −(1/Z0)·cot(π/2) = 0` is **already zero** because the
/// full `λ_g/4` line is self-resonant. Consequently there is **no loading
/// capacitor** at all — the structural contrast with [`ComblineDimensions`],
/// which shortens the line to `θ0 < π/2` and adds `C_L = cot(θ0)/(2π·f0·Z0)`
/// precisely to make up the missing susceptance. This struct therefore carries
/// **neither** a `loading_cap_f` **nor** a `theta0_rad` field (θ is fixed at
/// π/2 by definition).
///
/// All lengths are in metres. `gaps_m` and `target_k` are both length `N − 1`

///    open end is gapped `g_open` from the opposite rail; **no** resonator
///    touches both rails (an accidental short would make a cavity).
/// 2. **No loading-cap pads.** Combline draws a `w × w` cap pad at each open end
///    (the SMD `C_L` mounts there). The interdigital `λ_g/4` line is
///    self-resonant and needs **no** cap, so there are **no pads** — the trace
///    count is `N + 2 + 2` (N lines + 2 rails + 2 feeds), not combline's
///    `2N + 3`.
/// 3. **Full `λ_g/4` lines** — `resonator_length_m` from the engine (the
///    `θ = π/2` quarter-wave; combline's were the shortened `θ0 < π/2` line).
///
/// The geometry composed here is:
///
/// - **N resonator lines** — `N` (= `gaps_m.len() + 1`) parallel vertical
///   rectangles, each `line_width_m` wide (x) × `resonator_length_m` long (y),
///   **alternately offset** in `y` so the grounded end touches its rail and the
///   open end is gapped `g_open` from the opposite rail:
///   - **even `i`** (grounded bottom): `Polygon::rect(x_i, 0, w, l)` — shares the
///     `y = 0` edge with the bottom rail; open top at `y = l`, gapped `g_open`
///     below the top rail.
///   - **odd `i`** (grounded top): `Polygon::rect(x_i, g_open, w, l)` — top at
///     `y = l + g_open` shares the top rail's edge; open bottom at `y = g_open`,
///     gapped `g_open` above the bottom rail.
///
///   Resonator `i`'s left edge sits at `x_i = Σ_{j<i}(line_width_m + gaps_m[j])`,
///   so the centre-to-centre pitch is `line_width_m + gaps_m[i]` — the **real
///   solved per-section gaps**, not a uniform placeholder.
/// - **Bottom ground rail** — `Polygon::rect(0, −w, comb_right, w)`
///   (`y ∈ [−w, 0]`), spanning the comb x-range; grounds the even resonators
///   (vias are a fabrication annotation, not separate copper, as in combline).
/// - **Top ground rail** — `Polygon::rect(0, l + g_open, comb_right, w)`
///   (`y ∈ [l + g_open, l + g_open + w]`); grounds the odd resonators.
